# A-COMPARATIVE-STUDY-OF-CLOUD-CONTAINER-BASED-ORCHESTRATION-FRAMEWORKS-FOR-DEVOPS

DevOps is one of these huge trends. It is a combination or say unification of two major traditionally separate worlds of software development and operations into one common cycle. This report presents an in-depth review of the market's leading container orchestrators tools, with a particular emphasis on Kubernetes, Docker and Mesos. Kubernetes is recognized by industry experts as an exceptionally  orchestrator due to its capacity to scale and adjust to diverse operational demands. In certain circumstances, the inherent complexities of Kubernetes' architecture may result in substantial overhead, regardless of the platform's widespread adoption. On the other hand, Mesos is emphasized as a resilient alternative for companies that have already implemented legacy systems, providing enhanced orchestration capabilities for diverse workloads. To assess the effectiveness of these orchestrators in streamlining the deployment and administration of applications in cloud-based container environments and data centres, the architectural frameworks of these platforms are investigated in this document.
A critical element of the study comprises a comparative assessment of the durations required to provision clusters using Kubernetes, Mesos, and Docker Swarm. This comparative assessment furnishes organisations with quantifiable metrics to contemplate when choosing an orchestration tool. The primary purpose of the report is to provide organisations with the guidance they need to make well-informed decisions regarding their long-term technology strategy, operational team expertise, and current technical infrastructure.
